  <p>In recent years, Python has excellent performance in the fields of Internet, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, game, cloud computing, big data, devops, and enterprise software. </p>
  <p>PyCon is a global technology conference for the Python language community. PyCon China is an Annual meeting of Python, which licensed by PyCon and hosted by CPyUG(Chinese Python User Group). In the past 7 years, it has successfully held more than 20 times in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Xi'an and Hefei. </p>
  <p>The  8th China Python Developers Conference PyCon China 2018 is sponsored by PyChina.org, organized by 30 organizers from CPyUG / TopGeek and nearly 150 volunteers in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Chengdu. It will commit to  the development and application of various Python-related technologies in the fields of Internet and enterprise applications. </p>
  <p>With the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence, Python brings huge opportunities to developers.</p>
  <p>Each Pythoner has their own PyCon conference in mind, and the organizing committee of the conference is also working on a conference that will help Pythoner. So this year —— in the 8th year of PyCon China, we will break the past conventions and welcome all developers who are committed to promoting Python technology to join our organizing committee, lecturers, and volunteers. Together with the famous Python experts and enthusiastic Python promotion ambassadors to promote the Python language and its latest applications to the whole society. Let us work together to make the PyCon conference become an big party of gathering and sharing of experiences and achievements for pythoners once a year.</p>
  <p>The main venue of PyCon China 2018 is located in Beijing, because Beijing is the most concentrated city of Pythoners. We will try our best to meet the demands of Pythoners in various fields with the main venue of thousand people summit in the morning and the 5-6 breakout venue in the afternoon. At the same time, the Python special session for women was opened for the first time under the advice of Beijing core organizer Zheao Lee. </p>

Various front and rear end frames and middlewares are numerous and numerous. Many introductory developers have even worked for three or five years, limited to the use of a certain two frameworks, and regarded their own fancy framework as a standard. They are only skilled in the interface after the framework is packaged. Why does the framework exist and why in that design? When encountering difficult problems, and how to solve and optimize, it is not enough. This topic is based on the history of Web technology development, helping listeners to clearly understand the role and key points of Web-related core technologies, so that they can have clear goals and clear ideas when solving various problems encountered in learning work in the future.
